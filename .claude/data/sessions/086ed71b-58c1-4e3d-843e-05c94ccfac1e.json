    "Hello, Claude. Take a look at @NOTEBOOK_CAPABILITIES_REPORT.md and your memory in Letta from today (November 11, 2025) to get oriented in the project. We'll get started after that.",
    "Sorry, we're not doing the eval right now. I didn't think that would come up, my bad. What we're doing right now is implementing the changes in the feat/feynman-template branch. Don't switch to that branch quite yet: just letting you know.",
    "Alright, so here's where we're at. We had an issue last night that had to do with CommonJS vs ESM. I'll get into it a little bit more as to what specifically those issues were, though you can certainly use Letta to look at it yourself. But I think it's important to emphasize that this is a Smithery limitation, not a general one. While we favor Smithery over other registries, because frankly that's where the users are for this server, we don't want to necessarily make it harder for Cline, for example, to use this over the marketplace when we decide to deploy. \\\n\\\nThe core thing that we are working on today is improving usability for notebook functionality. We want this to be equally usable over HTTP (as it is used when the server is hosted on Smithery) and via STDIO, as you yourself are able to use it now. \\\n\\\nThe Feynman template system is one use of these notebooks. We're currently on \"Step Zero,\" aka we have established a source of truth documenting how the server works in its current state. \"Step One\" is to itemize the capabilities that we must serve with equal fluency/usability over STDIO with regard to notebooks. From this itemized list, we will make architectural choices that make this possible. \\\n\\\nI'd like you to examine the codebase here in the main branch, and ask me some questions whose answers will allow us to produce this list.",
    "Before answering your questions personally, I'd like you to review the Smithery documentation in @smithery-docs/ , which I've scraped from the web docs via Firecrawl. These docs will likely help you understand Smithery's config requirements and runtime better than I could explain them manually.",
    "Alright, so first of all I think that we definitely should detect the transport type. The actual implementation of this will happen in another step: we're not concerned with altering code right now or writing specs --> we're just listing capabilities that we need to work equally in both modes. With regard to the verification status, I have confirmed that the code in the Feynman template branch does *not* work with regard to templates in HTTP mode. Code execution does. \\\n\\\nNotebooks are currently ephemeral and this is the expected functionality at this time. I do think that it would be worth considering what capabilities an agent user like yourself would gain were we to implement persistent notebooks later on, but again, we're not worried about implementation at the moment. ",
    "I would like for you to document this list that you have produced in a markdown file at the root of the project. We will pause there while I review and validate.",
    "Alright, I've validated the list. Now, our goal is to produce one or more markdown specs (in a new specs/ folder, to be added to .gitignore) that describe the state of our codebase after a process has been executed to align it with the criteria defined in our analysis. \\\n\\\nTo get an idea of some design patterns that could prove useful for our own specs, take a look at the @mcp-ts-template/ folder, which is a well-regarded template by cyanheads for production-grade MCP servers in TypeScript. There are many good ideas in here that we're not implementing, but we're not concerned about any of them that don't have to do with our current scope. It might be useful to use Thoughtbox to formulate 2 or 3 options (where multiple approaches exist) for each architectural decision. Once you've formulated these, you should be able to present me with options via a dialogue here in the terminal chat that I can choose from. \\\n\\\nBe liberal with how many totalThoughts you use if appropriate: the maximum totalThoughts is 1000.",
    "I accept your recommendations. Let's generate those .md files describing the state of the codebase after a process has been executed to implement each recommendation. Place the files in a specs/ folder."
