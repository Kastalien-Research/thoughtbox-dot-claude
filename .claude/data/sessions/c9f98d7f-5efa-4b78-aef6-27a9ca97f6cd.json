    "I would like for you to put a specific instruction in the tool description for, or maybe it's the resource description for the init initialization resource as I'm seeing it is now. I would like for you to put something in that description that makes it very salient that the agent that is using this server should use that should call that resource first. If it would be easier to do it this way, we could just create a new tool that serves that initialization session beginning to end --> The intention was that we would be able to partition up what context we are showing to the agent depending on what the agent is working on. Before anything gets called, my intention was that only that tool would be available. Just the initialization workflow. That may be a little out of scope of what we're doing today, but I would like you to examine that. ",
    "Let's move to a new git branch and then add and commit those changes, and then we can push to remote. "
