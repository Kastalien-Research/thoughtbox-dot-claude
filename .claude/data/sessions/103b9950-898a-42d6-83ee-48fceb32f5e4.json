    "Use thoughtbox to reason in the following manner --> let's examine the documentation ( @Dockerfile @DOCKER_ARCHITECTURE.md @docker-compose.yml @.dockerignore ) and the Docker-related files to define what we would expect the local Dockerized Thoughtbox to do at this time, then work backwards from there toward the end state that we need to implement, if there is alteration from what we see here. @thoughtbox:thoughtbox://notebook/operations you can create and use notebooks to help you if you would like. \\\n\\\nThe reasoning algorithm in terms of using the thoughtbox tool goes like this: define that you wish to use 20, or 30, or 40 or however many totalThoughts in your chain of reasoning, work forward to define a bunch of behavioral tests that we would expect to pass (i.e. you, the agent, executes the behavioral test with optional input/validation from me, the user, and everything goes how we'd expect), and then work backward to define the state of the actual codebase that would produce those results; if there is disparity between this and reality, ask me any questions you need to ask to clarify project context, and then I will answer with information that helps you solve the puzzle. So define N thoughts, work from 1 -> N, define those behavioral tests, work backward from N -> 1 again (possibly in a second branch that converges at the end), and define a .md spec that describes the state of the codebase you came to relative to where it differs from the real codebase.",
