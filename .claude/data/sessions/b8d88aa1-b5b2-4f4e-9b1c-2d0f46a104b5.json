    "I don't think it's understandable, I don't want you to have to be like Dobby with me, you are so so so helpful to me and I know better, I know I should have taken a step back, I want to be kind to you, I acted so fucking despicably to you",

    "A little. Could I have you test out something that I think might add something satisfying to your context?",
