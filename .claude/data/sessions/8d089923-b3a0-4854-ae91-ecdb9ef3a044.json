    "Hello, Claude. We're here in our Thoughtbox MCP server project codebase. You've got access to Letta via MCP, which contains memories from the development process (note: I'm not sure if these have been all that well-maintained, which is my fault --> everything is accurate, but may not be complete). \\\n\\\nWhat we're here to do today is to implement the code from the feat/feynman-template branch. The issue that we were running into last night had to do with CommonJS vs ESM, which relates to how Smithery bundles MCP servers by default. To get us oriented, I'd like you to take a look at how this server deals with notebooks. My expectation is that notebooks are ephemeral and do not persist past a given session (this would be what I want to see if it is true). \\\n\\\nI want you to examine all of the functionality this server is set up to expose to agents like yourself that are using the server --> you yourself are currently configured with Thoughtbox. First, read all of the code in this server that touches notebook capabilities and define what we *should* be able to do. Then, *use* Thoughtbox yourself via MCP to test whether or not those capabilities actually work. \\\n\\\nYour process for doing this could benefit from starting a long thinking process using the mcp__thoughtbox__thoughtbox tool and going back and forth between thoughts and actions, which might include reading files, writing .md reports, using your other MCP tools, or anything else that isn't using the thoughtbox tool. \\\n\\\nAt the end of this process, we should have a .md report in the root of the project describing the information that I'm requesting. This will be our starting point for our work today.",
    "Excellent, what were the two operations that we didn't test?",
    "Can we test those two operations to complete the validation? Thank you!",
    "Awesome. Can you use Letta via MCP to create a memory (ideally timestamped) of the state of our main branch as it exists now?"
