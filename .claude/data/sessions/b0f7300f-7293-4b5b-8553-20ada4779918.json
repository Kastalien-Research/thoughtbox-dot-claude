    "We're not able to connect to Thoughtbox via MCP --> let's see what our entry point is for stdio, what's configured in package.json, and what's getting in the way of essential functionality",
    "Yes, okay, could you just explain to me one more time? I know I've been an absolute broken record with this, but just one more time: why do we have to have all of these different entry points? Why can't they all just be in the index.js? That's what I don't understand. Can you just tell me one more time? ",
    "So again, I need you to slow down, okay? Why can't all of these entry points be in the index.js? ",

    "Okay. Go ahead and do that. Then we're gonna test it again, okay? ",
    "Hey Claude, there's an awful lot in this dist folder that's not in the source folder. This stuff about UI thinking, all of that being separate, that's been gone from the source code for a long time. In the last couple of sessions, why is this still here? How is it still here? That's the better question. "
