    "Take a look at the Dockerized architecture for Srcbook, which is a local-first, TypeScript-first development platform that runs entirely on one's machine --> the notebook application provides an isolated, reproducible environment while maintaining full data locality through volume mounts.\n\\\nNow, consider the current goal for Thoughtbox --> we're currently looking to create a similar local-first version of this MCP server that maintains an auditable record of each chain of reasoning that a user agent works through using its capabilities. You yourself are currently equipped with Thoughtbox and can explore its capabilities liberally as a user (the limit on totalThoughts is 1000). I want to figure out how to refactor this server to be opinionated about being Dockerized locally AND to use containerization to get a widescreen view of what capabilities Dockerizing this Thoughtbox server opens up. ",
    "Would it help you to see the Srcbook project code yourself?",
    "yep! if you could give me the command to take the git repo out of the folder, that'd be good :) ",

    "@srcbook/ there you go",
    "So just as a note here, streamable HTTP is going to be the transport that we're serving Model Context Protocol from, from ThoughtBox. We're gonna shift away from using standard IO, standard error. However, while it is deprecated, Model Context Protocol does have relatively stable support for Websockets. That might be worth considering. \\\n\\\nStart drafting the persistence layer for Thoughtbox based on these patterns, and document your progress in a .md file in a new subfolder in specs/ ",
    "Go ahead and check this against the release candidate for the new Model Context Protocol specification. I believe that everything in here made it into the actual 11-25 spec, but yeah, go ahead and check this. @mcp-specs/modelcontextprotocol-2025-11-25-RC ",
    "So why do you think that it's the June 18th RC, the one attached just for November the 25th, 2025? ",
    "alright, I've got the actual finalized 2025-11-25 spec at mcp-specs/2025-12-25 --> you can review this as a source of truth"
