    "I'd like you to design and implement a new tool with multiple operations on the tool using the Toolhost pattern (you can read about it at @src/resources/patterns-cookbook-content.ts and i think at @src/resources/server-architecture-content.ts also), which is the approach taken by this server's tools already. \\\n\\\nInstead of actual function calls served as tools, this toolhost will serve prompts in the form of operations: that is, we will create a bunch of .ts fies in a new folder in the src/resources/ folder that contain constants as we see in @src/prompts/contents/interleaved-thinking-content.ts --> this content will be served to the agent that's using the server when they call the appropriate operation on this tool, which we will call mental_models. \\\n\\\nI propose that we create a tagging system of some kind indicating some basic categories of use case where a particular mental model, or conventional tool used when attempting to apply one like forcing functions,  is useful (i.e. Bayesian reasoning, OODA, etc.). This would help you create a little prompt to serve in the tool description where you would inform the agent what tags exist by dynamically populating the content of the enum we use to define the type.",
    "read the @glassBead-thoughtbox-blog.md to ensure we're3 still aligned with the principles of \"infrastructure, not intelligence\"\\",
    "Absolutely, I've put you in plan mode solely so you can utilize some of the native planning tools if you want: this is just a rubber-stamp approval when you propose it",
    "call the MCP server directly: I have restarted Claude Code. create a behavior test for the future3",
    "remember, though: it's you yourself that's intended to correct these",
    "sorry, to run these behavioral tests: we're not writing unit tests, these are workflows for you to executfe",
    "bingo, great work. this would be great to have for each tool",
    "I also think it might be cool to implement a folder system that corresponds with the tags that the mental model has in the tags[] array. So the hierarchical file system the agent is navigating through is documented, and there's syncronicity with the tags and the URI's.",
    "Just restarted Claude Code: try again",
    "Fantastic, now, take a look at the sum of the changes in this branch, describe them, and consider how we could make a number of commits that would be included in groups within separate branches, each of which would have a PR opened for it for me to review and merge",
    "We're not committing the .tessl files yet*\nor anything related to the self-improving script registry just yet",
    "saving that one, spacing it out :)",
    ".interleaved-thinking/ will stay local. so will chassit and .thoughtbox",
    "I just restarted the server: you can test it out as a sanity check",
    "It would be helpful to run Thoughtbox on Docker optionally to test HTTP better",
    "the precreated directories from Srcbook might actually map well to our resource templates",
    "correct me if i'm not intuiting correctly",
    "If I'm intuiting it right, we should enable all of the above except for 2 (for now) --> make a plan, I'll approve, then we'll wrap the session up by committing more new branches to Git for me to do code review and get them merged",
    "I just added the GitHub MCP server to your config: you can use it to execute the process of merging everything over. However, pay attention to the fact that Roomote (PR reviewer agent) is likely writing comments to each of the branches, and for those that it has not done so yet, it's in the process",
    "let's be sure to test all of the changes made in response to Roomote as a sanity measure",
    "Claude Code is restarted: let's test the changes using the tool directly via STDIO and via HTTP with the Docker-containerized version post docker-compose up and down",
    "wait, Smithery?",
    "this is local",
    "So, we need to have a third option for how we can do this --> I don't want to have to conform to Smithery's conventions on my local machine, only on Smithery",
    "You sure that creates an HTTP transport? It looks like the deprecated SSE transport to me",
    "Yes, please do",
    "are you not using MCP anymore?`",
    "Okay, so let's change it to HTTP from STDIO",
    "no, in the project",
    "alright, I've restarted",
    "it's not running now: if Roomote hasn't had anything for 19 or 20, let's merge the PR's in order",
    "Close those PR's and create new ones, then merge in GitHub as attempted before. Finally, when that's done, you'll pull the changes to our main branch here, and we're good",
    "Okay, I think we're good here. Write a summary of the session in a new docs/session-summaries/ folder. Then we're done"
