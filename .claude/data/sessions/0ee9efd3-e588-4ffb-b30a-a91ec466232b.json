    "Hello, Claude. Take a look at the commands/ folder in this project: this\n  is a copy of your slash commands library. \\\n  \\\n  In particular, I would like for you to notice the loops subfolder, as\n  well as the meta/ subfolder and whatever others you find compelling. \\\n  \\\n  What I want to do today is implement these as resources in the\n  Thoughtbox server, but to do so in a way that's searchable and progressively disclosed in a way that's similar to how (I believe) you're able to search through mental models currently with Thoughtbox.\\\n\\\nTo get us started, could you use the mental models tool and see if it's a searchable experience like I remember? ",
    "So I don't want to necessarily implement every single one of the workflows in the commands folder into Thoughtbox. Instead, I would like you to specifically hone in on the loops folder within the commands folder. You will be able to get a really good idea of what the scaffolding can be like just by reading that.\n\nFurther, when you are done doing that, I'd actually like your opinion on if there's any obvious ways that we could improve searchability from what we've already got on mental_models.",
    "Here's a question I have for you before we get started, and this is great by the way. How useful is the mental models tool, do you think? Just you personally as the user of this. Do you think it's useful, or do you think it's too either token expensive or non-salient during active work to be much help to you?",
    "Now this is interesting. How could we enable automatic suggestions on the Thoughtbox server? This could be very powerful. And I know that there are some ways in the new MCP specification, the one that came out the 25th of November, 2025, that would make that possible. The problem is, is that very few Model Context Protocol clients, including yourself, support those new features. So if you know of a feature that already that we could use to do this, I'm all ears. ",
    "So here's the question. Before I give you that, how are you thinking that we would have thoughtboxes detect these things? Because right now the only option that I see is regex, which is rough. "
