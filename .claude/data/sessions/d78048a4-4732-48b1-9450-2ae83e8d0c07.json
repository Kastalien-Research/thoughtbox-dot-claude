    "alright, Claude: you're connected to the thoughtbox-1 server: on that server, what resource templates do you see?",
    "Wait, clarify what you mean by running the pre-implementation version.",
    "Okay, yeah, go ahead and rebuild the server and I will restart Claude Code and you should be able to see it.",
    "Wait, are you rebuilding the main server? Or did you build the thoughtbox-1 MCP server? we're talking about the server at @trees/resource-template-fix-1/ ",
    "So the MCP config is pointing to the one in the worktree because that's what we're working on right now. Now that we've done that, what resource templates do you see?",
    "Alright, awesome. So what I want you to do now is bring the changes from that work tree into the main project and then get rid of the other two implementations, resource template fix two and three. Then we are going to do a git commit. After we do that git commit, we are going to merge these changes into the branch named feat/interleaved-thinking and get rid of the feat/interleaved-thinking-resource-templates branch.",
    "Awesome. So now let's go ahead and delete that last git worktree and then we're going to pause.",
    "All right, now finally, let's do a get add and commit in this branch. But let's make sure that we're only adding the changes that we just merged in",
    "I didn't know that. Let's add the .dockerignore, .gitignore, and .npmignore. That'll do it. Then we'll pause.",
    "Sorry, one more thing. Let's push to remote.",
    "Now let's just go ahead and get a sanity check going. First of all, what resource templates do you see? Second of all, if you're seeing all three as expected, I want you to read the research mode guide, and then I want you to try reading this resource template (testing failure): thoughtbox://interleaved/invalid",
    "Sorry, it isn't thoughtbox-1 anymore. It's just thoughtbox.",
    "All right, before we go any further, this went very, very, very well. I would like for you to ultra-think on everything that went right about this process, and then I would like for you to generate a markdown file documenting the process as you experienced it.",
    "Sorry, continue. I interrupted you by mistake.",
    "Go ahead and try using it correctly, just for a sanity check.",
    "So, is it unclear what the tool is expecting?",
    "So I guess I'm just very, very curious why you're not using the right input schema: Windsurf used it no problem. to remind you, it's this. \\\n\\\n{\n  \"name\": \"thoughtbox\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"thought\": \"...\",\n    \"thoughtNumber\": 3,\n    \"totalThoughts\": 3,\n    \"nextThoughtNeeded\": false\n  }\n}    \\\n\\\nyou're doing this: \\\n\\\n{\n  \"name\": \"thoughtbox\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"operation\": \"create_thought\",  // ❌ Wrong! No such operation\n    \"args\": \"{...}\"                  // ❌ Should be direct params\n  }\n}",
    "Yeah, so what I'm making sure is that the tool itself wasn't showing you the wrong schema. I don't know where you got that from. Are we sure that everything's okay?",
    "Wait a minute, does the cookbook not have the right input schema?",
    "Okay, just making sure. We're pausing here.",
    "Alright, so now, I want you to review your own review of that session along with Windsurf's review --> from these two, we should be able to piece together everyone's role in that successful run: mine, yours, and Windsurf's. \\\n\\\nuse thoughtbox (correctly!) to help you structure your thinking about the process as a whole.",
    "We have a regression in this server somewhere. We have a regression. The server is not working. Over Smithy, Ry, you were able to connect to the server locally, but other MCP clients cannot connect to the server locally. Nothing has changed in the configuration.",
    "We have a regression in this server somewhere. We have a regression. The server is not working over Smithery. you were able to connect to the server locally, but other MCP clients cannot connect to the server locally. Nothing has changed in the configuration, and nothing in the last run changed any code that would be causing this. what happened/",
    "I need you to listen to me, okay? Smithery itself told me that I needed to remove those fields. They were unrecognized.",
    "At this time, windserve serve and they are configured exactly the same way. They were configured exactly the same way earlier when they were successfully connecting. They are not getting an error message. Please focus up, okay? And also, I have already told you. I have already told you that it is the local build that we are working on right now. Forget Smithy, okay? Can you do that for me?",

Forget Smithery, okay? Can you do that for me?",
    "I promise you, I promise you, I fucking promise you it did not affect the standard I/O build. The STD I/O build would not be affected by the Smithy YAML file. Stop it.",
    "It's not connecting. It can't connect. Nothing else would have happened between those two commits that is not in Git. Nothing else happened. And how exactly would it not be related to the code changes? Because if we have errors that are appearing over HTTP when it is hosted on Smith 3 and we also have issues locally, there's a problem with the code. What are you missing here?",
    "I need you, Claude. You're pissing me off. I've already told you the config hasn't changed. It's not the fucking config. Get off of that shit, okay? You're really making me mad.",
    "?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!! What in the fuck are you talking about? What in the absolute fuck are you talking about?",
    "This was all working when I left this computer. I have not touched anything in this code. You and Windsurf were doing great a couple of hours ago. Why, why are you both... did you both get five times dumber in the last two hours?",
    "Stop it, stop it, stop it. I already have.",
    "No, I didn't say that. I said that you can connect locally and Windsurf cannot.",
    "I already did. It's not getting any logs.",
    "And motherfucker, motherfucker, I already fucking told you that there was an HTTP 500 when it served over. I already fucking told you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!",
    "I didn't say HTTP 500, the voice-to-text AI is fucking up. I said you cannot access resource templates over HTTP. What the fuck is the matter right now?",
    "Then roll it back. Then roll it back. But I have to say this for the record: I only removed that because SMITHERY told me to",
    "Dude, for the last time, stop looking in the smithery index file. It's too big. Stop it. Stop it.",
    "WHY WOULD THEY BE AVAILABLE!??!?!?!?!?!? WE AER STILL DEBUGGING THE LCOAL ISSUE: YOU WOULD HAVE TO DEPLOY FIRSTjpokdq;lehgbvinpuokadfhiojgrteqf'",
