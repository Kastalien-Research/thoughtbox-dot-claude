    "Alright Claude, so what we're going to be doing here in this session is we're going to be doing some road mapping and this is going to lead to a master specification of everything that I'm going to need to launch the paid version of Thoughtbox via the Google Cloud Platform deployment. \\\n\\\nI'll describe what I know we need so far. First of all, we're going to need a web app, and we'll need to decide where we're hosting it. I would assume that Google Cloud Platform is the natural choice, but I'm not much of a web developer, so let me know what the pros and cons are there. In this web app, we're going to need a page where where users can sign up for Thoughtbox --> once users have an account and log in, they should have a dashboard landing page. this landing page should have a navbar that populates different dialogs without leaving the page location. these dialogs should be for:\n\n1. Playground --> this will be a modern chatbot interface where users can experiment with Thoughtbox\n2. Traces --> users will be able to view reasoning chains from previous sessions, or an active one\n3. Billing --> users will be able to enter their billing information \\\n4. (later) Configuration --> users will be able to make changes to how Thoughtbox is configured for their user\n\\\nMy guess is that Next.js makes the most sense to use a framework here, which is why I wonder if Vercel is the better deployment option. We'd also be able to make natural use of the Vercel AI SDK in that context, which is important for the chatbot. I think that AI SDK 6 has full native support for MCP as well. \\\n\\\nFor the payments layer, I think we should use Stripe. We're going to charge $0.01 per call to Thoughtbox. I'll need to set up a Stripe account, but that's separate from what we're concerned with here, which is the full architectural picture of everything we need to launch. \\\n\\\nAsk me any questions that you need to ask to get the full picture and we'll iterate from there. Additionally, start producing the master specification document (markdown) in a new master-spec/ folder at the project's root, which we'll gitignore/dockerignore/etc. --> use the description above and document those pieces + review the codebase and existing specs to help you document what we've already got",
    "$0.01/call is the intended pricing: good catch. \\\n\\\n1. Users should be able to sign up with both email/password and Google Auth | let's do paid-only from day one | when a user hits $0 balance, we can allow a small grace period similar to OpenRouter \\\n\\\n2. I'll supply the LLM --> I'll find a free-tier model on OpenRouter. Users should be able to bring their own API key. For simplicity, let's only support Anthropic for BYOK at launch.\n\\\n3. Per-pay credits for sure | Minimum credit purchase should be $5 | we'll implement auto-refill at some point, but let's push that off til post-launch \\\n\\\n4. Let's do Vercel for the frontend and GCP Cloud Run for the MCP server",
    "1. I'll actually throw this one back to you: what do you see the pros and cons to each option as? \\\n2. Let's do moonshotai/kimi-k2:free \\\n3. Reset grace to $0 \\\n4. There aren't any beta testers yet: I'll want to grant free credits to a good number of these."
