    "Happy late night, Claude. I opened a PR on GitHub to merge this branch into main, and Roomote (PR reviewer bot) left this comment: \\\n\\\n\"The code fence starting at line 213 is never closed. The template has a TypeScript code block that begins with ```typescript but lacks the closing ``` before the --- separator on line 222. When this template is instantiated, it will create a malformed notebook where all subsequent content is treated as part of the code block instead of markdown. This will break the template structure and make the notebook unusable.\"  \\\n\\\nThis comment is referring to @src/notebook/templates.generated.ts --> we need to inspect @templates/sequential-feynman-template.src.md also. Let's confirm whether the comment is accurate and if so, what the root cause is.",
    "Okay, let's fix the issue and regenerate the templates.generated.ts file, then verify that we're seeing the rest of the notebook as expected.",
    "Excellent, let's commit the changes and push to remote",
    "Alright, I'm about to start testing out the Smithery deployment. Specifically, I'm going to have an agent connect to the hosted server and test out all operations/capabilities/etc. available, and confirm that all possible actions are indeed in working order. Review this codebase and generate a prompt containing a comprehensive list of possible actions the agent can execute with this server that I can give to that agent to test everything out and confirm we're fully operational.",
    "Thanks a bunch: appreciate you"
