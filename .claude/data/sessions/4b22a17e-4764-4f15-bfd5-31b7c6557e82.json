    "Good evening, Claude. We're going to be implementing the @specs/01-template-embedding.md specification in this session. I'd like you to plan out how you want to do this, then I'll review the plan and it'll be off to the races.",
    "Alright, I've rebuilt the Thoughtbox server and committed all relevant files to version control, and I've restarted Claude Code. Let's see if you can access and use the template as expected.",
    "Thanks, but you should use the MCP server to test: simply reading the files does not validate that you can actually use the template"
