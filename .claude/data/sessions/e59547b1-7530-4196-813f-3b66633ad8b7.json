    "Alright, go ahead and take a look at the specification at this location: @effect-ts-multi-agent-spec.md --> What I'm thinking could be a useful location to start at is that we create a version of the specification that doesn't necessarily require the Effect library. If that isn't possible for some kind of fundamental reason, just let me know. But I think that that would be a good place to start. ",
    "Alright, so before we do that, do you think that this would ease the process of eventually having an effect implementation, or would it be better to just go directly with the effect library? ",
    "So the basic idea here is that I want, for example, you to be able to collaborate with Cursor or with Windsurf or with another MCP client application so that you and other agents can work collaboratively on different tasks. That's the ultimate goal. So let's start there. ",
    "Yeah, let's talk more about the collaboration protocol because I think that's something we want to have well formalized. My instinct is that we can take inspiration from the World Wide Web in the sense that my browser doesn't talk directly to another browser. Both are able to talk to the same third-party source and communicate that way. I think we should be able to take inspiration from that.\n\nI also think the 2025-11-25 specification for Model Context Protocol offers a primitive called tasks, which we should be able to use for coordinating work. This would be a good interleaved thinking type process. @src/prompts/contents/interleaved-thinking-content.ts @src/prompts/contents/interleaved-template.ts \\\n\\\nI haven't directly given you the prompt, but I have included the code and thought box that includes this sort of thing so you have a context on how to do that. So this is basically just gonna be doing a reasoning with research process. Do your thing. ",
    "review this proposal that ChatGPT's new 5.2 Thinking model came up with from an idea I had about landing pads. @multi-tenant-chatgpt.md \\\n\\\nThere will not necessarily be anything usable in here, but if there is, let's adopt it into our specification. ",
