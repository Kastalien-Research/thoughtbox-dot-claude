    "Hello Claude, I would like for you to review the readme in this project and see if there are both sufficient and correct instructions here on how you would install this MCP server. For reference, you can take a look at the URL that I've pasted. The goal of this session is to submit the ThoughtBox server to the Cline MCP Marketplace -->  https://github.com/cline/mcp-marketplace",
    "Before we get started here, I would like for you to use whatever tools that you have for web scraping, which I think is just Firecrawl, to see if the examples that we've given for configuration are actually accurate.",
    "Can we check to see if that Y flag is actually necessary for this server?",
    "Alright, let's go ahead and come up with a plan to make the necessary updates. I'll review that plan, and then we will make the revisions to the readme.",
    "Alright, let's go ahead and commit those changes and then push them to remote.",
    "Hey, are we entirely sure that that Smithery instruction is correct? Typically, you're able to go to the servers page on Smithery itself, and there's a list of commands that you can get per client. It might be better to just provide a link to the Smithery deployment and let users know that the instructions on how to install via Smithery for their client are on that page. https://smithery.ai/docs/getting_started/quickstart_connect https://smithery.ai/server/@Kastalien-Research/clear-thought-two"
