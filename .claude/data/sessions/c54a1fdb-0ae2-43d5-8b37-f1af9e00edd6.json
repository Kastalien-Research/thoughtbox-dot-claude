    "Sorry, the goal of a no-docker local runtime, that was an artifact of a previous conversation that I was having. That's prior that I want to revisit. My apologies. ",
    "So here's the question: do we need to actually solve MCP task support, or could we just—is there some way to do this just with HTTP? Or is there some way for us to implement like the mechanism that that utility is using? My gut tells me there's some way around this. ",
    "Yeah, take a look and see what wiring this up would involve. ",
    "Take a look at the specific files, draft the changes into markdown. ",
    "What would this look like from your end? In terms of user experience, agent experience maybe. What would this process look like if you were using it to collaborate with another Claude Code instance? ",
    "Absolutely, sketch out what those integration changes would look like. 100%. ",

    "What would testing this entail in the context of a testing process where an agent actually uses the new build to do things?",
    "I accept your recommendation of option 3. Set that up.",
    "Hang on a second. If we're going to use the test script approach, we should at least call the Claude Agents SDK. Check out the docs at @claude-agent-sdk/ and consider that we could use scripts containing calls to the Claude Agent SDK as atomic units of functional programming with some non-deterministic intelligence in them: agentic scripts, if you will.",
