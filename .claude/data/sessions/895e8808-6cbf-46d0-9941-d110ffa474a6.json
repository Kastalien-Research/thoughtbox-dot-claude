    "Alright, Claude: here's the situation. I've been trying to get Thoughtbox deployed to GCP with the intention of referencing that hosted endpoint on various other services/registries, but I think I've taken us a little far down the complexity rabbit hole. Are you able to look at Git and see the version of the code here in the main branch that was committed as part of PR #25 (named \"Feature/persistence layer\")? I'd like to open up a new git branch and populate that branch with the PR #25 version of the code (full SHA is 34947b164f44da9c27bff19dff3ed030916c145d --> commit on GH is 34947b1)",
    "yeah, let's push this branch to remote with the same name",
    "Good work. Now, here's what I want you to do. Let's examine how we can alter this code to assume that we want to run either locally via STDIO or on Smithery via HTTP. You'll want to look at the @smithery-docs/\n  folder, as well as at the @mcp-specs/ folder. Finally, you may want to look at the codebase on GitHub at https://github.com/waldzellai/clearthought-onepointfive via your GitHub MCP tools (NOTE: the migration branch is what you're after) to see an example of how to do this in the index.ts",
    "Yeah, plan out your workflow by starting with the desired end state and working backwards (use Thoughtbox --> if it's not available tell me, might not be in Plan mode)",
    "run smithery build",
    "Hang on. Are the migrations and sqlite and everything still in here?",
