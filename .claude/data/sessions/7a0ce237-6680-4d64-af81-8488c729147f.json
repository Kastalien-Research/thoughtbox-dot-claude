    "Hello Claude, we are going to be refactoring the MCP server in this project, but what we're going to be refactoring is not functionality, but instead is the setup of our progressive Disclosure Pattern, and what we're choosing to disclose when. Below is a description of the task to be accomplished as stated by Claude Desktop --> \\\n\\\nThat's a much stronger claim, and if it's accurate, it should be reflected in how we describe the tool. Let me revise the handoff document:\n\nThoughtbox Tool Description Redesign: Context & Specification\nStrategic Background\nThoughtbox is an MCP server providing cognitive enhancement tools for LLM agents. It's currently performing well on usage metrics (16.2k monthly tool calls on Smithery, outperforming venture-backed competitors), but we've identified an activation gap: many users install and configure Thoughtbox but don't actually use it.\nData from a recent conference appearance showed a 19x spike in initializations without a proportional increase in tool calls. Users are discovering and installing Thoughtbox, but their AI agents aren't reaching for it.\nThe Core Problem\nTool descriptions are written like documentation, not decision heuristics.\nWhen an agent receives a user message, it scans its available tools to determine whether any should be used. Current tool descriptions answer \"what does this tool do?\" — but the agent's actual question at decision-time is \"should I use this tool right now?\"\nThis is compounded by the unique nature of MCP tools: the user installs Thoughtbox, but the agent decides whether to use it. If the agent doesn't recognize when Thoughtbox would improve its output, the tool sits unused regardless of how well the user understands it.\nDesign Principle: Progressive Disclosure\nMCP server design should follow progressive disclosure — only provide context about things the agent has already decided to use. Thoughtbox already does this well with the Patterns Cookbook, which is injected on the first and final tool calls rather than being present in the initial description.\nImplication: The pre-decision tool description should be optimized for triggering a decision, not for informing usage. Instruction and detail come after commitment.\nThe Foundational Concept: Thoughtbox as Reasoning Substrate\nThoughtbox is not a tool for special cases. It is the reasoning substrate for any agent.\nIf an agent is equipped with Thoughtbox, the presence or absence of native \"reasoning model\" capabilities in the underlying LLM becomes irrelevant. Any tool-calling model can engage in long-running reasoning processes and structured workflows by using Thoughtbox.\nThe pattern is \"interleaved thinking\": rather than think → tool call → think → tool call, it becomes ALL tool calls, with Thoughtbox providing the reasoning steps between other tool invocations. Thoughtbox externalizes and structures the reasoning process itself.\nImplication for trigger design: The question is not \"when should the agent use Thoughtbox?\" but \"when should the agent skip Thoughtbox?\"\nOpt-Out Exception List (When NOT to Use Thoughtbox)\nThoughtbox should be the default. Skip it only when:\n\nSimple factual questions — \"What is the capital of France?\" No reasoning required.\nFully-specified mechanical requests — \"Use Firecrawl to scrape this URL\" — the user has already done the reasoning; the agent is just executing.\nTrivial tasks where Thoughtbox overhead exceeds value — Single-step operations where structured reasoning would cost more context than it saves.\n\nIn most other situations, the agent would be better off calling Thoughtbox first.\nProposed Information Hierarchy\nGiven the \"reasoning substrate\" framing, tool descriptions should follow this priority order:\n\nDEFAULT BEHAVIOR — Establish that Thoughtbox should be the first consideration for any non-trivial task\nEXCEPTIONS — Specific, pattern-matchable conditions where Thoughtbox can be skipped\nVALUE CLAIM — What the agent gains by using Thoughtbox (structured reasoning, course correction, maintained context across steps)\nMINIMAL CAPABILITY SUMMARY — Just enough to understand what the tool provides\n\nThe HOW (usage patterns, parameters, reasoning strategies) gets disclosed progressively after the first call via the Patterns Cookbook.\nCurrent State vs. Desired State\nCurrent thoughtbox description opening:\n\n\"Step-by-step thinking tool for complex problem-solving. Supports flexible reasoning: forward thinking, backward thinking, branching, and revision...\"\n\nThis frames Thoughtbox as a special-case tool for complex problems, requiring the agent to assess complexity before use.\nDesired framing:\n\n\"Reasoning substrate for agents. Call Thoughtbox first for any task requiring thought, planning, analysis, or multi-step work. Skip only for simple factual questions or fully-specified mechanical requests. Provides structured reasoning with branching, revision, and dynamic planning — enables any tool-calling model to perform like a reasoning model.\"\n\nImplementation Scope\nThe following tool descriptions need to be rewritten with the default-behavior-first framing:\n\nthoughtbox — the primary reasoning tool (should establish itself as default reasoning substrate)\nmental_models — structured reasoning frameworks (secondary tool, called from within Thoughtbox workflows)\nnotebook — literate programming tool (secondary tool for code-heavy reasoning tasks)\n\nSuccess Criteria\nAfter implementation, agents configured with Thoughtbox should:\n\nTreat Thoughtbox as the default first step for any non-trivial task\nNot require users to explicitly request \"use Thoughtbox\" or \"think step by step\"\nOnly skip Thoughtbox for genuinely trivial or mechanical operations\nShow significantly increased tool call / initialization ratio\n\nOpen Questions for Implementation\n\nHow assertive should the \"default behavior\" language be without seeming presumptuous to other tools in the environment?\nShould the exception list be exhaustive or representative?\nHow do we phrase the value claim to be compelling without being hyperbolic?\nWhat's the right balance of brevity (for scannability) vs. completeness (for accurate triggering)?  \\\n\\\nBefore we actually begin doing anything, I would like for you to ask me any questions that you need to ask. Also, examine your own environment to see what these tools are currently showing you in your context window.",
    "1. We're only changing the description strings for now, though I expect that we'll want to update the priority annotation of the thoughtbox tool itself to 0.99 later on. The cookbook content can remain unchanged. \\\n2. the secondary tools' descriptions *should* explicitly reference thoughtbox, though they will remain independently triggerable in practice. \\\n3. Let's go assertive --> if users start complaining about it, we have a signal that the complaining users are getting value out of Thoughtbox that we've screwed with by adding this, and they have a preference that our design should take into account. This would affirm the value-add of the server as a whole. \\\n4. I'm actually inclined to address the long description on the notebook tool. We want to be considerate of the agent's context, and those operation examples would probably be better stored in a resource that we make a reference to in the notebook description versus putting it in the description directly. \\\n5. I am going to say that we should make these opt-out exceptions implicit. If we design the description for the ThoughtBox tool well, then the agent will be smart enough to understand whether or not it should actually use that tool. I think that probably every agent would be smart enough to do that regardless, but that's my framing. \\\n6. We're going to know if the new descriptions work based on some behavioral tests that I'm going to run with a variety of coding agents. Leave the testing to me. :)",
    "I'm very sorry to interrupt you, but I figured putting you in plan mode would make this easier. Sorry about that. Go ahead.",
    "One thing to add here: let's do these updates in a new Git branch. Further, let's change the name of the CLEAR_THOUGHT_TOOL to THOUGHTBOX_TOOL, and update the README or other documentation/resources in the codebase as/if necessary.",
    "Go ahead and commit the changes. We're not going to push to remote yet, just commit them here locally."
