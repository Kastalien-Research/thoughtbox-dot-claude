Use the contents of the following commands to help you --> they represent high-quality workflows ( @.claude/commands/meta/ulysses-protocol.md @.claude/commands/meta/refactoring-game.md ) \\\n\\\nWhen you're done with that process, write a .md file containing your first draft of that slash command in the root of the project",
