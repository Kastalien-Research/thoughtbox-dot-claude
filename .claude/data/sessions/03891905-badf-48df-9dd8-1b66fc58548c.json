    "/thoughtbox-observatory:interleaved-thinking (MCP) task=\"I'd like you to engage in a multi-branched reasoning process involving multiple tool calls, perhaps with 100-150 thoughts, to explore the search space using the spirit (if not the actual approach) of Jeff Clune's algorithms related to how we could implement the Effect-TS library into this Thoughtbox server, with a mind toward enabling multiple MCP client applications to collaborate by calling Thoughtbox --> the agents would all be connected to the same server. Think of the idea as Thoughtbox as a bigger workstation than it is now, set up for co-working between agents. Create a specification at the end of the process in markdown. Call Letta and Firecrawl liberally, as well as any other tools you have that would be useful (context7?)\" thoughts_limit=200 clear_folder=false"
