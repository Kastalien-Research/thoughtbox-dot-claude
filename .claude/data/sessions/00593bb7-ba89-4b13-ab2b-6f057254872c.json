    "/thoughtbox:interleaved-thinking-workflow (MCP) \"I'd like for you to open up a new branch, then use the MCP and native tools in your environment as described in the interleaved-thinking-workflows pattern I'm giving to you now to reason at length, using several methods and many thoughts (limit: 1000 --> be very, very liberal with this number until returns are no longer clearly net positive to any new branch of thought or approach), about everything that you can do with this server --> many things you would **like** to do with this server --> plan/perform a research workflow involving subagents to perform research that gives you high-fidelity, Bayesian-modeled feedback on the workflow that you designed + gives you knowledge that would extend the productivity threshold of the long task I'm describing here, and which you are executing at the time that item in the TODOs comes up --> perform the most salient changes included in that research haul to the codebase --> PAUSE to allow me to restart Claude Code to reset the connection so you connect to the new build --> design a BDD-inspired set of workflow specs that will not only test each operation by itself, but which describe real and complex/multi-stage operations that you will test each operation on each tool with **in the process of executing them, as a byproduct**. --> PAUSE and allow me to restart you again --> perform the behavior-driven tests yourself by using the MCP server directly. Notes: if you come up with clear effeciencies to this workflow in-flight, trust you own judgment over mine EXCEPT with the behavioral tests on the new server, which you should always find a way to do.\" 1000 true",
    "I'm sorry to interrupt you: I need to look at your MCP config to get Letta access fixed --> it's an important part of making this an easy workflow for you, as you'll see shortly. :)",
    "This might be more difficult than I thought. Okay, here's what you'll do: use Firecrawl right now to find out the command that would clone the MCP Knowledge Graph server from MCP themselves into this project. You would want to examine the functionality and the code on that server, then devise a way to implement it as a tool on our Thoughtbox server. Finally, implement the .md specification that you write in the previous step to align the codebase with the version of the codebase that has Memory as a tool on the server (i.e. described state, not workflow/process)",
    "Alright, we're restarted. Design those BDD workflow specs that test all of the memory tools through real usage scenarios. One such usage scenario might involve a similar thing to the interleaved-thinking-workflow that you've got tracked in @.interleaved-thinking/ right now, but on the server side. These graphs would be ephemeral by default, with the option to create a notebook that serves as a checkable, runnable \"spec companion\" to the JSON that you'll be able to store with a different tool like persist_context_graph or similarly named. In case you need the notebook application I used the formatting from as a point of reference, I've cloned it into the project (you'll need to manage .git, npm, etc. to accomodate its presence) for you to review --> it's really good.",
    "Another note, and I'm sorry again for interrupting, but you'll like this and it'll inform the structure --> I've configured you with an MCP server connected to Tessl's Specification Registry. The shape and structure of these specs should inform your design for the spec in general, since if we convert from Tessl's conventions to .src.md by default, this raises the possibility of implementing self-improving affordances to the model using this server (add .src.md files for each Tessl spec or for each of a subset --> when designing your own specs, use this format to promote easier apples-to-apples comparisons with official Tessl implementations --> write and iterate over a workflow protocol that creates a standard mapping between the two formats, accessible via MCP resources --> if a workflow turns out really, really well, you should be able to save the file to a persistent memory store or, if using locally, to the filesystem --> over time, as you take the best pieces of all of the specs and get more feedback from results, you will have access to better workflows --> your performance improves as you use the server this way). \\\n\\\nYou do not have to implement the self-improving workflow, but it might be good to at least make a spec for this self-improving spec library for later.",
    "I recommend that your entities be cleared on this test decision, and come up with a *real* decision regarding the spec you produced on the self-improving spec library :) --> get hella meta with it",
    "I'd like for you to review this file: @adat.md --> this features the basic self-improvement pattern and mechanism I'm drawing off of. It might help you to see the research paper it came from. \\\n\\\nThis is a signature approach from its author Shengran Hu, and his coworkers at Sakana AI --> using patterns found in evolution, where mathematical or formal \"proof\" of improvement is a non-category and empirical results drive the entire process, instead of solely from applied mathematics or other heavily proof-oriented fields in terms of their approach to validating and updating knowledge. It is my belief that it is for this very reason that natural use of a process that implements the same process at the information level as ADAT will be more effective than standard Bayesian reasoning, though perhaps I will have you implement that separately. You may see updates as you read: Windsurf is currently updating the formatting, but not the content",
