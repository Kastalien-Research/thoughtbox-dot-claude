    "Good evening, Claude. We're going to be implementing the @specs/02-export-load-operations.md specification in this session. I'd like you to plan out how you want to do this, then I'll review the plan and it'll be off to the races.",
    "We are not going to be simulating either standard IO or HTTP. Once you are done implementing the code changes, I am going to manually guide you through testing via standard IO. And then I am going to use the Smithery CLI to test HTTP in the Smithery dev environment.",
    "We aren't going to be testing with the inspector either. You're going to be using it directly.",
    "Sorry to interrupt you there, but I needed to restart Claude Code so that your connection would reset and you would be working with the version of the server that you just updated. Now you can try to test the implementation.",
    "Hey, remember we are not simulating HTTP. I just wanted to reiterate that. Sorry to interrupt you again. Proceed.",
    "Could you provide me with a prompt that will help the default model that Smithery's dev environment uses know what it needs to test and what to expect?",
    "All right, Smithery's default model has delivered a report that says all tests are passing. This is good. Let's commit the files you made changes to and push to remote.",
    "The Roomote PR reviewer bot left this comment on the PR I created to merge this branch into main: \\\n\\\n\"The code fence starting at line 213 is never closed. The template has a TypeScript code block that begins with ```typescript but lacks the closing ``` before the --- separator on line 222. When this template is instantiated, it will create a malformed notebook where all subsequent content is treated as part of the code block instead of markdown. This will break the template structure and make the notebook unusable.\"  \\\n\\\nCan you verify this? I tested this after implementation and both STDIO and HTTP testing agents reported all tests passing. Don't update the code just yet if you verify: I need to know whether the tests *actually* passed before we change anything.",
    "So, I'm not saying that your tests were supposed to touch this. The previous agent that I was working with to implement template embedding said that sequential Feynman, as well as the file generated at @src/notebook/templates.generated.ts were passing.",
    "Okay, so this is a problem because a parsable markdown was specifically one of the things that it was supposed to test and that it told me specifically was working. So now this casts doubt on every test that was run.",
    "Sorry, so wouldn't the core issue be in the script? Here's the file. @scripts/embed-templates.ts ",
    "So just to clarify here, what do you mean that no testing occurred?",
    "So here's the big problem. It claimed to verify that all of the sections were present. It claimed to export the notebook to markdown. It claimed to inspect the actual cell content. And it did claim as well to test the round trip and to match the cell structure against the template structure. All of these it explicitly claimed to have tested. What is more troubling is that two agents did this, both Smithery's dev environment agent as well as my local agent here."
