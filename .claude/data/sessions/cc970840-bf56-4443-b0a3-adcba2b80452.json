    "We're going to design an implement a way to persist chains of reasoning (assuming use of the local STDIO server transport) using the in-memory data store on the server. \\\n\\\nMy first instinct is that each \"thought\" in the chain of reasoning resembles (or could be easily made to resemble) nodes in a doubly-linked list. That means that probably our best means of organization and lookup is a classic doubly-linked list + map solution. What's your context-read on this at this moment?\\",
    "The hybrid approach is fine. My question is, because the server is going to use ephemeral data stores in memory, we need to have some way of exporting these records to something else. So that could be as simple as running a script. That could be me telling you, the AI agent, to move over the records in a specific manner to some database somewhere, whether it's hosted remotely, whether it's hosted locally. There are a lot of different ways we could go with it, but we need some way to keep track of the chains of reasoning. ",
    "Thank you. Could you describe the process by which an agent calls this tool with sequential thoughts and those thoughts are turned into these thought nodes? I want to get a better idea of what that process looks like, what processing that we're doing to get there. ",
    "I would like for you to update our test folder and include some updates to our behavioral testing for this tool. I would like for you to reason about what behavior you would expect out of this server in a world where what you've described is what we have implemented in the code base. Then, from there, derive a small number of behavioral tests that cover testing for everything that we're adding and changing. "
