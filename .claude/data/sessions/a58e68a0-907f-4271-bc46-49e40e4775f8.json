    "are you kidding, can you not see the folder?",
    "specs/observatory/ - 6 spec files (00-vision.md through 05-integration.md)",
    "PAUSE. Are you...implementing this in an entirely different project??",
    "OH, i'm sorry, that's entirely on me --> keep going",
    "Create a PR to merge into main",
    "Fantastic, I've had my cloud agents review and make changes, let's pull them into the local worktree",
    "please do! I also want us to test directly, and that'll involve updating the @cc_mcp_config.json file with a connection to the /Users/b.c.nims/kastalien-research/thoughtbox-observatory/dist/index.js file (I'm assuming that's what it is). if so, set \"command\" to \"node\" and \"args\" to an array containing a string with the location of the entry file, in the manner you see there already",
    "Quick question, can we set the observatory port to the taxicab number? :)",
    "alright, can I see the observatory in a browser, or is that a separate step? (we've restarted Claude Code)",
    "Just verify the server is responding first?",
    "What remains in our workflow to implement the remaining changes? Are you able to see where we were at before solidifying the changes from 00-02?",
    "So, here's the question I have before we continue: are we assuming anything about the MCP client in this design? I don't think we are, just a sanity check",
    "So, if we were to do a basic HTML page, what would we be able to demonstrate about the functionality? Realtime updates as the agent produces more thoughts?",
    "What would we *not* be able to demonstrate in the HTML UI with regard to what's happening on the backend? Anything? Or is the React code exclusively for making the UI look better?",
    "Alright, good. Now, let me make sure that our specification reflects my desired end state --> as each thought gets produced, I want us to see a new \"cell\" in the emerging Mermaid diagram (note: Mermaid specifically and stylization as such can wait), and to be able to click on the cell which routes to a \"thought page\" containing the contents of the message sent to the MCP server producing the thought. Later on, we will add various other metadata, but for now, we can just include the message, maybe the response too actually. Sorry, typing without deleting: definitely the response too.",
    "So sorry to interrupt you, but let's actually add a 03point05-previsualization.md specification in the observatory folder in specs/ containing the HTML implementation stuff, and alter 04-visualization to reflect a reality where we've implemented the minimal HTML version first",
    " sorry to interrupt again, I changed my mind on the response. unnecessary for what I'm trying to demo: sorry, that's totally on me",
    "alright, do you still have the .spec-orchestrator folder up to date",
    "We haven't completed 3.5 though, have we? Did we do 05? Deploy Task agents to execute the following workflow: for each of the files in the .spec-orchestrator/ folder, identify all claims made in the document. claims are single statements that can be verified for truth or disproven. then, for each claim, identify where in the code the verification sources are. next, verify each claim against its source. finally, bring any mismatches into alignment with the sources in the code.",
    "have we done the HTML yet?",
    "test it with the live server",
    "Interesting, I only see the second thought. I wonder if there's something about the cookbook or moving nextThoughtNeeded to false that's screwing us up",
    "Okay, I see what's happening: I'm not able to see the thoughts unless I'm actually in the session in the UI as they come in. They disappear if I click outside the session page also.",
