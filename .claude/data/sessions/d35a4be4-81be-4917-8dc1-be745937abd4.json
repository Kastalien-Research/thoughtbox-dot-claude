    "check out @tests/behavioral/gcp-mcp-master.md --> This is intended to be a series of executable behavioral tests done by an agent that is directly configured with the Thoughtbox MCP server and specifically the version deployed on Google Cloud Platform. I would like for you to validate that all of these tests are expected functionality. I would also like for you to consider the conditions under which each of them must occur. So for example, the observatory UI, would that still run on localhost? I doubt it if it's the deployed version.\n\nFinally, you may wish to use an interleaved thinking process which you can find in Thoughtbox's resources. That may help you when it comes to researching what we would expect if you need to use external context. ",
    "So here's the design challenge for us. I do want to, in production, have the observability UI. And here's the context that I want it to appear in.\n\nWhen users sign up for the paid service—because this is intended to be a paid MCP server—when they sign up for that, they'll be able to access a playground environment. And in that playground environment, they'll be able to... I'm actually so sorry. Playground is not the right word.\n\nThe user will log in on a web page somewhere, and I want them to see a UI populating with the reasoning visualization as I had implemented it, more or less, in the local-first version on which this is based.\n\nWhat are your thoughts at that point? Sorry, I know that might be a little bit confusing. You can ask me clarifying questions if you want. ",
    "To clarify a little bit, it's not necessarily that they have a web dashboard that automatically opens. It's more that they can go to a specific location in their profile on the website and see the observatory there. So it would be accessed through a URL. But it wouldn't necessarily automatically open a web browser. With regard to the implementation you described with Firebase, are there already existing means of visualizing Firestore data? Is that what we're saying? ",
    "Okay, cool stuff. That makes more sense. Also, I'm sorry if I'm using Firestore and Firebase interchangeably. I'm a late beginner to cloud architecture and things like that, so sorry about that.\n\nYes, take a look at existing observatory UI code to assess how much could be reused for the web version. Once we have an answer to that, we'll be able to modify this master behavioral specification because we might want to separate concerns if it's going to be a bunch of extra work at that point.\n\nObviously building out the website is something of a separate project, so it might be better to scope our concerns only to the non-visualization functionality, if that makes sense. ",
    "update the spec document with this separation, thank you",
    "Okay, you still have access to the gcloud CLI, correct? ",
    "Alright, I would like for you to connect yourself to the deployed Google Cloud Platform server. You'll be updating this config file .mcp.json   -->  You may need to perform some lookup references to find out how to do this. You may not, but you may need to. Do it if you need to. ",
    "Alright, I can see that you are connected in the terminal dialog. Can you confirm as a user?",
    "Run behavioral tests against the prod deployment now. Great work.",
    "I want to put in a quick note that we're using just a test key, so we've bypassed any charges that would be going to a user account as a result of using the server at this point. Other than that, this looks really good. "
