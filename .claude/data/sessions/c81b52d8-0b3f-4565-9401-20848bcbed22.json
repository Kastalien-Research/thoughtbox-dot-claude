    "Is this server ready to deploy to fly.io?",
    "But wait a minute, Claude, we already have this server deployed. Why, why would that have changed? Why, why would any of that have changed? If it did change, I need you to look at the remote, and then I need you to look at this, and I need you to see why we would have something different at that level. ",
    "Also, I don't know where this fly.toml came from. I have no idea where this came from. I didn't put it here. I don't know why it has a Google Cloud project on it. We're not using Google Cloud anymore. ",
    "Why the fuck are you running Google Cloud stuff? I just fucking told you we're not using GCP. I just fucking told you we're not using that anymore. ",
    "I've told you three times in the last five minutes. It's on Fly.io. ",
    "Nope, I just replaced it with the right one. And as you'll see, it bears zero resemblance to what was there before, so I don't know where the other one came from. It was probably just some more fuckin' flop. ",

    "What do you mean branches diverged? What do you mean the codebase is in a messy state? Be fucking specific! ",
    "Jesus fucking Christ, man. Jesus fucking Christ. Why the fuck does anybody fucking listen to me? ",
    "So how did codebases get into such messy states, Claude? ",
    "Exactly, and that's because nobody is looking at their fucking instructions. Nobody's looking at their fucking instructions. When's the last time in this chat or in any chat that you used memory? That you updated your memory? ",
