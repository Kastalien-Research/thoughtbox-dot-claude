    "Hello Opus 4.5, this is our first time working together, it's good to meet you. ",
    "Here's what I'm working on. I am trying to publish this MCP server called ThoughtBox to the official MCP registry. However, I'm getting the following error message when I try to do this. \\\n\\\n(base) b.c.nims@Mac thoughtbox % mcp-publisher publish\nPublishing to https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io...\nError: publish failed: server returned status 403: {\"title\":\"Forbidden\",\"status\":403,\"detail\":\"You do not have permission to publish this server.

I am the owner of that organization. Do you know what could be happening here?",
    "This is strange. I see the MCP registry login under authorized GitHub apps, but I don't see it anywhere under OAuth apps.",
    "Yeah, I don't see any of this. I'm not sure how to install this app for the organization. It's not appearing on the Kastalien Research organization page at all. On my personal profile, there's no option listed to even add it to the organization.",
    "Yeah, go ahead and create that workflow file. I thought there was one that was already in there. Let's make sure that one's set up properly.",
    "Yeah, go ahead and commit and push this workflow change. I guess we'll need the new version tag as well.",
    "Alright, so this is bizarre. I'm getting this same issue that I was getting before.
