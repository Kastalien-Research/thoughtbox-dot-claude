    "Here was the output of the previous chat and what we implemented in that chat.  \\\n\\\nSummary: Doubly-Linked List Persistence with Auto-Export\n\n  Files Modified/Created:\n\n  1. src/persistence/types.ts - Added new types:\n    - ThoughtNodeId - Node identifier format {sessionId}:{thoughtNumber}\n    - ThoughtNode - Doubly-linked node with prev, next[], revisesNode, branchOrigin\n    - ThoughtIndexes - Computed indexes for reverse lookups\n    - SessionExport - Export format with version \"1.0\"\n    - ExportOptions - Export configuration\n  2. src/persistence/storage.ts - Added LinkedThoughtStore class:\n    - Map-based storage for O(1) lookups\n    - Doubly-linked list with tree support via next[] array\n    - Computed indexes for revisedBy and branchChildren\n    - toExportFormat() method for creating export data\n  3. src/persistence/export.ts (NEW) - SessionExporter class:\n    - Exports to ~/.thoughtbox/exports/\n    - Filename pattern: {sessionId}-{timestamp}.json\n  4. src/persistence/index.ts - Updated exports\n  5. src/index.ts - Added:\n    - Auto-export hook when session closes (nextThoughtNeeded: false)\n    - autoExportSession() private method\n    - exportReasoningChain() public method\n    - export_reasoning_chain tool registration\n  6. tests/thoughtbox-behavioral.md - Added Tests 8-13:\n    - Test 8: Linked Node Structure\n    - Test 9: Tree Structure from Branching\n    - Test 10: Revision Tracking in Nodes\n    - Test 11: Auto-Export on Session Close\n    - Test 12: Manual Export Tool\n    - Test 13: Node ID Format Consistency\n\n  Key Features:\n\n  - Auto-export: Sessions automatically export to filesystem when nextThoughtNeeded: false\n  - Manual export: export_reasoning_chain tool for exporting active sessions\n  - Tree structure: Branches create multiple children via next[] array\n  - Forward pointers: Stored in nodes (revisesNode, branchOrigin)\n  - Computed indexes: revisedBy and branchChildren rebuilt on demand\n  - Export location: ~/.thoughtbox/exports/{sessionId}-{timestamp}.json  \\\n\\\nNow, I would like for you to verify these statements by executing the behavioral tests as well as examining the integrity and coverage of the behavioral tests themselves after the fact. ",
    "Quick question: what should we do about the edge case that you found, as well as the fact that new sessions are not necessarily always going to start on thought, for example, one of N? ",
    "now try, CC MCP connection is using new binary",
    "Alright, let's do some git commits and then push to remote on the same branch. Once you're done with that, pause. Write good descriptions ",
    "Write a description I can use for the pull request containing those four commits"
