    "I have Roo Code running off this same prompt: execute the same process \\\n\\\nAnalyze the mcp-ui examples directory and create a comprehensive specification for understanding how mcp-ui works through interleaved thinking using the Thoughtbox MCP server. \n\nThe goal is to:\n1. Understand the architecture and functionality of mcp-ui by examining all examples in mcp-ui/examples/\n2. Use interleaved thinking with Thoughtbox MCP server to alternate between analysis and native tool usage\n3. Generate detailed markdown reports in a new mcp-ui/reports/ folder\n4. Create behavioral tests that a human user can run to improve their understanding\n\nPlease define:\n- Analysis scope and methodology\n- Key deliverables and acceptance criteria\n- Interleaved thinking process framework\n- Report structure and content requirements\n- Behavioral test design principles\n- Integration approach for consolidating findings\n\nFocus on creating modular, testable outputs without hard-coded environment variables.",
    "Alright, excellent work. So now what I would like for you to do is take a look at the rest of the contents of the @mcp-ui/ folder and specifically the TypeScript SDK and the docs. Let's compare those against what we have here, make any necessary changes. And where appropriate, use the same interleaved process that you used last time. Feel free to use web scraping tools as well as memory tools. ",
    "Excellent work. Write a summary report of everything that you've produced here and optimize it to be readable by you yourself. ",
    "I'm sorry to interrupt you here, but I haven't been focused on the eval for some time. We're going to need to update that to what I'm about to be doing, which is implementing MCPUI in the ThoughtBox MCP server. ",
    "Sorry, I accidentally restarted the editor. Go ahead and do that again. Sorry. ",
