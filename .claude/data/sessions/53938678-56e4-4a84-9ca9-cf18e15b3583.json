    "Alright Claude, I would like for us to take a look at the package.json and take a look at some of these build scripts. I'm not entirely sure that a lot of this makes sense, specifically with regard to HTTP local. A lot of this seems confusing. If you could just do a review there and tell me what seems out of place, that'd be great. @package.json ",
    "And just to clarify, this does mean that there is no way to build HTTP without using the Smith Rebuild, is that correct?",

    "Okay, so if you could just go ahead and create a plan for how we could clarify this. I'm not entirely sure how this got to this condition other than to just say that it's slop. I'm a year after starting to work with coding agents, I'm still struggling with managing the slop. Anyway, that's redundant. If you could just create that plan, that'd be great. Thank you.",
    "Go ahead and do the smithery build to make sure we're all caught up across the board",
    "Alright, let's commit those changes to the package.json and then push to remote.",
    "Alright, now let's add those changes to package-lock.json and the capabilities.md file then commit and push",
    "Quick question: do we actually need to have the instructions for deploying to Smithery, given that this is my server, and I don't know, that seems like something that would be relevant only to me, but I may be mistaken there.",
    "Go ahead and remove the \"Deploy to Smithery\" section and update the README to fix the script names."
