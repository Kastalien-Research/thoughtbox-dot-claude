    "Alright Claude, so I have a special exercise for you today that you may find fascinating. I'm going to guide you manually through the first few steps and then once we're done with that section you're going to run autonomously for a long time. :)",
    "So here's what we're going to be doing. I have done a little bit of digging, had some conversations, and I have become convinced that adding Sampling as a supported primitive on Thoughtbox, from Model Context Protocol, could be profound. and I mean profound as in actually profound. The kids over say profound and iconic these days but I think that the right sampling implementations over time could become transformative to what these kinds of tools are. So how we're going to do this is I'm going to just piece by piece give you some introductory information and when that is done I am going to have you run a highly parallel process in a bunch of different git work trees. And at the end of that process you're going to look at what you created, you are going to test out everything which will be its own thing that we need to implement, so maybe I guide you through that, same as always. But the idea is that we come up with a bunch of patterns for the sampling primitive and for its use in thought box servers like these that do not themselves rely on the functionality of external services. Since we know that a thought box is never going to itself deliver a connection to some other service that we don't have visibility into, we can be significantly more liberal in where we use sampling. Right?",
    "@glassBead-thoughtbox-blog.md This is the first file. This is a blog post that I wrote defining the essential characteristics of thought boxes. Read this closely before we continue.",
    "I'm going to want you to review the files in this folder that I'm about to paste here for you. This step of the process is just going to be making sure that everything in here is accurate. You do not need to test it yet. I just want you to read through and know what's in there. @specs/sampling-integration/ ",
    "1. Dependency order: I think that my intention at the time was to go sequentially here but just to say it out loud I was not as personally involved with the development of those specs as I was trying to be. To the best of my understanding they're mostly correct but we're definitely going to need to iterate.    \\\n\\\n2. I do not expect all MCP clients to be able to use sampling. At a high level, what we're going to want to do is if the initial handshake process between ThoughtBox and whatever agent is trying to connect to ThoughtBox through their onboarding MCP client, we are going to write some kind of validation in there that if the MCP client does not advertise sampling capabilities, we assume that the client does not have them. Finally, number three, template DSL extensibility. There is not a plan for versioning the DSL as it evolves, actually. There's no plan at all.",
    "Alright, so here's the next step. Before you get started, I will want you to confirm that you have access to these tools. You should have access to Firecrawl for scraping web data and access to Leta for memory. You can use these along with some of the resource templates that are in there to help you scaffold your reasoning process. The first thing, let's just make sure that all the expected tools are in your environment and we can move from there.",
    "So, first of all, you spelled it fine. I'm going through a voice-to-text app, so sometimes there are mistranscriptions. So I think this probably isn't the most salient task to do at this point. But where my mind is going is that somewhere, I'm not gonna lie, Claude, I completely lost my thinking. I probably do need to lay down and go to sleep. Sorry, I will come back.Alright, so here's the next step. Before you get started, I will want you to confirm that you have access to these tools.

    "So here is what we need to do before we get to the implementation/execution phase. We need to go through and look at those specifications in the markdown files. We need to go through and make sure those are accurate",
