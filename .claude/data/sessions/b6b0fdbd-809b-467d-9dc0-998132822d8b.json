    "/speckit.constitution Create project principles for Thoughtbox, an HTTP-based MCP server for cognitive enhancement.\n\nFocus on:\n1. **The Rising Tide (Cumulative Intelligence)**: The system is a shared reasoning engine. Every agent interaction creates durable, structured data that enriches the global context. Agents should benefit from the \"work\" done by previous agents.\n2. **Agent Self-Observability**: Agents must have the tools to introspect their own reasoning history and the history of others. The system provides a \"mirror\" for the agent to see its own thought process, enabling error correction and meta-cognition.\n3. **Reasoning as Data**: Thoughts are first-class data entities (numbered, linked, timestamped, branched), not just ephemeral text. They form a queryable graph.\n4. **Context Economy**: Maximize value per token. Use efficient formats (like the Thoughtbox Cipher) to transmit complex reasoning without exhausting context windows.\n5. **Agent-Centric Navigability**: The codebase and API must be trivial for an AI agent to traverse and understand. No hidden logic; \"thick\" documentation explains *why*, not just *what*.\n6. **Legibility & Clarity**: Code is for reading (by humans and agents). Prioritize clear intent and navigable structure over clever abstractions.",
    "Okay, let's back up. Okay. Why are we still talking about Websets? Why are we still talking about Exa? Why are we... Dude, did you read the code? Don't answer anything else. Did you read the code? Did you actually read it? ",
    "SON OF A BITCH WHY DID MY VOICE TO TEXT DO THAT?!!??! I SAID WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT EFFECT-TS AND WEBSOCKETS? DID YOU READ THE CODE?!??!?!",
    "Okay, that is explicitly what you are supposed not to do right now. Explicitly. And no, no, you're not reading services at Observatory, they're not in the fucking project anymore. ",
    "But you have to read the code first ",
    "What do you mean that they form a queryable graph? Where do you see a graph? ",
    "Okay, are we sure that there's not a little bit of confusion happening here between you the agent working on the code base and you the agent that would be using the tool for literally anything else? Because we're not using the cipher in the code. ",
    "Hey man. Why would we have to take out five of the six principles over? Jesus Christ. Fucking hell. ",
    "I didn't say that. I asked you two messages ago a question. I just asked you a question if the two things were getting conflated. That's all I asked. And the users are agents. ",
    "### IV. Context Economy\n\nMaximize value per token. Use efficient formats (like the Thoughtbox Cipher) to\ntransmit complex reasoning without exhausting context windows.\n\n**Non-negotiable rules:**\n\n- Tool responses MUST NOT include redundant boilerplate on every call\n- The Patterns Cookbook MUST be embedded only at session bookends (first thought,\n  last thought), not every response\n- Cipher notation SHOULD be offered for extended reasoning chains\n- Resource annotations MUST specify `audience: [\"assistant\"]` for agent-only\n  content to avoid polluting user-facing responses\n- Export formats MUST support both verbose (human-readable) and compact (JSON)\n  modes\n\n**Rationale:** LLM context windows are finite and expensive. Every token spent\non overhead is a token not spent on reasoning.  \\\n\\\nAlright, so what's this about export formats? And cipher notation, it's... The agent's gonna use it for any reasoning chain. We're not going to force the agent to do that, but we are...\n\nHow many times do I have to say this? Over and over and over and over and over again. I've been saying this shit over and over again for months. But you never learn, you never use your memory, you never update your memory. ",
    "So why aren't you checking if these fucking things exist? Why are you guessing? You're guessing! YOU'RE GUESSING! ",
    "I don't like this Constitution. I don't like this at all. The only reason I was trying to set this up is so that we can finally, after days of me fighting you for it, can just have a fucking accurate specification for what's actually in here. ",
    "All I wanted is a fucking, just a fucking slash command workflow that would, that would document the fucking code base! @master-reference/detailed-spec.md ",
    "I only ran that command so that I could get MCP set up because I was so fucking tired of fighting with you to build this out myself, so I was gonna use something else, but even that didn't work. "
