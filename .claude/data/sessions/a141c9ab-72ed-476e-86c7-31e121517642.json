    "In order to validate against the running server and to do it locally, we're going to want to Dockerize this, right? This is deployed to Fly.io rather than Cloud Run now, for the record. ",
    "Hey, sorry about that. Do we need to include a header with the API key? Sorry, I know that we're not able to connect at the moment, but I think that has to do with the config. I've disconnected from the remote thoughtbox servers. The current config entry is: \\\n\\\n\"thoughtbox-docker\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:8080/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"X-API-Key\": \"tb_live_tThdPMy-50zXLH0QCUjoIfhd6AsRLJGB\"\n      }\n    }",
    "Sorry, go ahead, go ahead. ",
    "Yeah, we're still not able to connect directly through MCP. I can confirm that it's running though. ",
    "You are directly connected now via MCP. I have restarted Claude Code.",
    "We're reconnected. Try agian",
    "We're reconnected. Go for it.",
    "Before making that decision, we should look to see if we need to either inject it somehow or have that built into the template. Neither of those might be the right move. I don't know. I just think it's worth considering. ",
    "Well, we also have to remember that we're going to be deploying whatever code we have here to the remote fly.io deployment --> with that in mind, do either of these look significantly better than the other?",
    "Yeah, let's add global tsx. In keeping with the code mode principle, I think in general it's better to use the approach that LLMs have more training data on. ",
    "Alright, give it a shot. ",
    "That's bizarre because I see the tool available. You obviously were able to see it in your environment because you were able to call it. ",
    "There's one in the sequential alignment template, right? ",

    "dSo just to let you know, if you need to implement something new, like if this is something that we have to add support for, you can look in this folder. This folder is the project where I got the formatting for our notebooks from. Our notebooks are based on these notebooks. \\\n\\\nsrcbook/ ",
    "Alright, give it a go ",
    "All right, let's try again. ",
    "Here, try that one more time. ",
    "Alright, let's try again. ",
    "Alright, now try. It takes a little while for the tools to become available after the server connects.",
    "1Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got my wires crossed for a second. I misunderstood what you were saying. Thank you very much. Go ahead. ",
    "Alright, restarted Claude Code: give it a shot.",
    "the thoughtbox response structure doesn't include it at the top level...should it?",
    "fix that so sessionId is consistently populated, yeah.",
