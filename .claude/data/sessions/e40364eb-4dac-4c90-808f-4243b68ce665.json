    "Hey, are you running the stdio server?",
    "Alright, continue with what you were doing. Note that we're focused on running the STDIO server locally first and getting that working first. Also, consider the benefits and drawbacks of using HTTP vs just WS. They may be obvious: I just don't know the necessity if it's there, that's my own knowledge gap",
    "let's open up a new git branch and add/commit/push our changes, then open a PR",
    "Awesome. The only thing we have left to do is to test the UI by you initiating a long reasoning process by using Thoughtbox in all of the supported ways (note: just the thoughtbox tool itself for now). I have the Cursor IDE browser open and I'm ready ",
    "Wait a minute, the server just failed. Idk what happened",
    "wait a second, so just confirming, the changes are now here in our local project instead of the thoughtbox-observatory worktree one level above this project in the filesystem hierarchy?",
    "Thoughtbox is failing to connect entirely.",
    "WHOA, slow down there. You're literally in the file right now via the IDe connection. Where is HTTP coming into this? Port 1729 is for WS. What's happening",
    "Okay, you're connected. Is the WS server running?",
    "It's kind of working, but it's behaving strangely with the offset. We might need to review how we're doing that.",
    "Here's a clue: thought 2 doesn't appear on my screen",
    "Alright, we're connected. Try the same branching test from before. I'll describe what I see in the UI",
    "[Image #1] here's thought 1, we need to simplify something here.",
    "[Image #1] this is what we ended up with ",
    "The MCP request section shouldn't appear at the same time as the live reasoning graph: [Image #1]",
    "Try the branching exercise now",
    "Nah, these aren't appearing right. The detail panel DOES stay hidden properly, but I can't see the full graph. Further, we can't see the connections between the nodes.",
    "Alright, let's try again",
    "a few things: first, the nodes should just populate horizontally unless there are too many of them in the same row. Second, I can't see the entire graph: a good bit of it is below the viewport. Third, it seems like the reasoning session populates in real time when you call Thought 1, but Thought 1 itself has a delay",
    "Alright, give it a try",
    "This is significantly better. We've got a little buffer at the beginning where nothing appears, but by the third thought it was appearing onscreen. [Image #1]",
    "Hmmmm...is there a way to shorten the round-trip time at all?",
    "Alright, test it out",
    "Let's try again: we're reconnected",
    "try now",
    "Wait what do you mean vertically, the chain is still left-to-right, yes?",
    "Alright, let's try using Thoughtbox again. Here's the UI prior to an active session being started: [Image #1]",
    "Getting closer: the first thought appeared immediately. However, as you can see (I couldn't get a screenshot til thought 2), our max size on one of the nodes is too big. We should limit our max sizing to improve the visual experience. [Image #1]",
    "Alright, give it another go",
    "This is much better. Let's commit our changes before continuing --> this is much better after a small number of thoughts, we just need to test more complex reasoning workflows.",
