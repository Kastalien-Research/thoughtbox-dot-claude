## OODA Phases

### OBSERVE

Assess requirement quality:

```
1. APPLY SMART criteria scoring:
   
   SPECIFIC (0-1):
     1.0: Precise values, no ambiguity
     0.7: Mostly precise, minor ambiguity
     0.4: General direction, significant ambiguity
     0.0: Completely vague
   
   MEASURABLE (0-1):
     1.0: Clear pass/fail criteria exist
     0.7: Criteria exist but need interpretation
     0.4: Partial criteria, some aspects unmeasurable
     0.0: No way to verify completion
   
   ACHIEVABLE (0-1):
     1.0: Clearly feasible with known techniques
     0.7: Feasible with some research/exploration
     0.4: Uncertain feasibility
     0.0: Appears impossible or contradictory
   
   RELEVANT (0-1):
     1.0: Directly serves spec objectives
     0.7: Indirectly serves objectives
     0.4: Tangentially related
     0.0: Unrelated to spec purpose
   
   TIME-BOUND (0-1):
     1.0: Clear phases/milestones
     0.7: Implicit timeline
     0.4: No timeline but not blocking
     0.0: Timeline needed but missing

2. DETECT anti-patterns:
   
   VAGUE:
     indicators = [
       "should handle ... appropriately",
       "should be user-friendly",
       "should be performant",
       "should be secure",
       "etc.", "and so on"
     ]
     detected = any(indicator in requirement.text)
   
   COMPOUND:
     indicators = [
       " and ",
       " also ",
       ", as well as",
       multiple_verbs > 1
     ]
     detected = contains_multiple_distinct_requirements
   
   ASSUMPTIVE:
     indicators = [
       references undefined terms,
       assumes prior implementation,
       implicit dependencies
     ]
     detected = has_unstated_dependencies
   
   UNTESTABLE:
     indicators = [
       no quantifiable criteria,
       subjective terms,
       no observable behavior
     ]
     detected = cannot_write_acceptance_test

3. CHECK consistency:
   
   For each related_requirement:
     → Do they contradict?
     → Do they overlap?
     → Do they have implicit dependencies?
   
   conflicts = detected contradictions/overlaps

OBSERVATION OUTPUTS:
  smart_scores = {S, M, A, R, T}
  composite_score = avg(smart_scores)
  anti_patterns = [detected patterns]
  conflicts = [detected conflicts]
```

### ORIENT

Identify improvement strategy:

```
1. CALCULATE priority areas:
   
   weak_dimensions = filter(smart_scores, score < 0.7)
   
   priority_order = [
     "SPECIFIC" if detected "VAGUE",
     "MEASURABLE" if detected "UNTESTABLE",
     dimensions in weak_dimensions by score ascending
   ]

2. SELECT transformation type:
   
   IF "VAGUE" in anti_patterns:
     transformation = "CLARIFY"
     strategy = add_specific_values_and_examples
   
   ELIF "COMPOUND" in anti_patterns:
     transformation = "SPLIT"
     strategy = decompose_into_atomic_requirements
   
   ELIF "UNTESTABLE" in anti_patterns:
     transformation = "REFRAME"
     strategy = convert_to_given_when_then
   
   ELIF "ASSUMPTIVE" in anti_patterns:
     transformation = "EXPLICIT"
     strategy = surface_hidden_dependencies
   
   ELIF conflicts.length > 0:
     transformation = "RECONCILE"
     strategy = resolve_conflicts
   
   ELIF composite_score < threshold:
     transformation = "STRENGTHEN"
     strategy = improve_weakest_dimension

3. ESTIMATE improvement potential:
   
   expected_improvement = estimate based on transformation type
   will_pass = (composite_score + expected_improvement) >= threshold
```

### DECIDE

Commit to transformation:

```
IF composite_score >= threshold:
  decision = "ACCEPT"
  rationale = "Requirement meets quality threshold"
  
ELIF iteration >= MAX_ITERATIONS:
  decision = "ACCEPT_WITH_CAVEATS"
  rationale = "Max iterations reached, best effort result"
  caveats = [weak_dimensions, remaining_anti_patterns]
  
ELIF transformation == "SPLIT" AND would_exceed_requirement_limit:
  decision = "FLAG_FOR_REVIEW"
  rationale = "Splitting would create too many requirements"
  
ELSE:
  decision = "TRANSFORM"
  rationale = f"Applying {transformation} to address {issues}"
```

### ACT

## Termination Conditions

- **Success**: `quality_score >= threshold`
- **Failure**: Transformation would violate constraints (too many requirements, etc.)
- **Timeout**: `iteration >= MAX_ITERATIONS` (default 3)

## Composition

### Can contain (nested loops)
- None (atomic loop)

### Can be contained by
- `authoring/spec-drafting` (inline refinement)
- `orchestration/queue-processor` (batch refinement)
- `verification/acceptance-gate` (pre-acceptance polish)

### Parallelizable
- Yes: Independent requirements can be refined in parallel
- Conditional: Requirements with potential conflicts should be sequential

## Signals Emitted

| Signal | When | Payload |
|--------|------|---------|
| `requirement_accepted` | Meets threshold | `{ id, score }` |
| `requirement_refined` | Successfully transformed | `{ id, score_before, score_after, transformation }` |
| `requirement_split` | Decomposed into multiple | `{ original_id, new_ids: List }` |
| `requirement_flagged` | Needs manual review | `{ id, reason, caveats }` |
| `conflict_detected` | Inconsistency found | `{ requirement_ids, conflict_type }` |

## Transformation Examples

### VAGUE → SPECIFIC

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "fast response times" | "95th percentile response time ≤ 200ms" |
| "handle high load" | "sustain 10,000 concurrent connections" |
| "secure authentication" | "OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, tokens expire in 1 hour" |
| "user-friendly error messages" | "error messages include: error code, human-readable description, suggested action, support link" |

### COMPOUND → ATOMIC

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Users can search, filter, and sort results" | FR-1: "Users can search by keyword" <br> FR-2: "Users can filter by category, date, status" <br> FR-3: "Users can sort by relevance, date, title" |

### UNTESTABLE → TESTABLE

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "The system should be reliable" | "GIVEN normal operation <br> WHEN the system runs for 24 hours <br> THEN uptime shall be ≥ 99.9% <br> AND no data loss shall occur" |

## Example Usage

```markdown
## Phase 3: Refinement

For each requirement in spec.requirements:
  
  Execute @loops/refinement/requirement-quality.md with:
    INPUT:
      requirement: requirement
      context: spec_context
      related_requirements: spec.requirements
      threshold: 0.85
    
    CONFIG:
      MAX_ITERATIONS: 3
    
    ON requirement_refined:
      UPDATE requirement in spec
    
    ON requirement_split:
      REPLACE requirement with new atomic requirements
      RE-INDEX requirement IDs
    
    ON requirement_flagged:
      ADD to manual_review_queue
    
    ON conflict_detected:
      ESCALATE to user for resolution
```

## Quality Checklist

Before accepting a requirement:

- [ ] No vague qualifiers remain (appropriately, properly, etc.)
- [ ] All values are specific and measurable
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable (can write automated test)
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit and referenced
- [ ] Scope is clear (what's NOT included)
- [ ] No conflicts with other requirements
